<br><br>

## How can we use RS? I

## How can we use RS? II

- To map the response variables, i.e., species occurrence or abundance, infections
- To map the predictor variables
- To validate predictions

### Other projects underway or in the pipeline {.smaller}

- Integrated surveillance system for vector-borne diseases based on spatial information (FMS, kan; BID funding).
- Incidence of respiratory diseases as a function of remotely sensed air quality and LULCC (citizen science and web-based data mining) (PhD Thesis project Abraham Coiman - CONAE)
- Distribution of mother-to-child transmission diseases and access to health in the triple border Argentina-Bolivia-Paraguay (Doctoral thesis project Carla Rodriguez Gonzalez - CONICET)
- Comprehensive epidemiological characterisation of intestinal parasite infection in children in the Department of General José de San Martín, Salta (Doctoral thesis project Matias Scavuzzo - CONICET).
- Geospatial modelling of malnutrition in children and adolescents in Argentina (Doctoral thesis project Micaela Campero - CONICET)
- Environmental variables associated with non-communicable diseases (Postdoctoral fellow Juan Diego Pinotti)

## Gaps, opportunities and challenges

## Difficulties and challenges I

- Compromise between different resolutions 
- VHR, LiDAR, UAV, Hyper-spectral (U$S)
- Missing data, clouds, shadows (spatial and temporal interpolations)
- Need for corrections of various types
- Large volumes of data vs. bandwidth, storage and computational capacity (cloud computing, parallelisation, learning time and U$S)

Field data will always be needed! :)

## Difficulties and challenges II

- Updating and digitisation of disease cases and intervention data
- Harmonisation of records at different levels and from different systems
- Facilitating data access and public access to aggregated health data 
- Training of staff
- Development of standardised, reproducible and scalable methods
- Commitment and allocation of resources

## New missions

## UAVs

## SDGs and One Health
